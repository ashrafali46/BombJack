* Parts list, Book of Materials, stock code links to ordering websites needed



* _MEWR needs to be connected to the header
	Actually, all the memory interface needs to be connected
	The VSYNC output also needs to be connected to the header, or exposed to a memory address



* The expansion bus and the memory write signals will need to be translated to the internal memory write signals




* VSM Pattern generator clock input bug
	When the clock input is set to external positive edge but is not on the root sheet then the signal is not used?
	The pattern generator windows still pop-up though, although they do not scroll.

	
	
* 4C/4D when run at 6MHz will generate "sub optimal write pulses" errors with default values. Running at 1MHz fixes these issues.
	* The output pixel data seems to be better when the timing is reduced.
	* Investigate the output for read/write timings of these memory ICs for 6MHz operation.

	
	
* There is also the possibility to allow the horizontal pixel clock and/or the vertical raster position to be read via a latch and suitable address chip enable logic of an 8 bit latch
