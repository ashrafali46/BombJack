* Need to update ReadMe to reflect new design



* Split design into layers, use common bus for internal communications
	* Renumber component refs depending on their layer, 1xx main, 2xx screen... etc.
	* Main: Clocking, video timing, pixel combination and palette lookups
	* Screen + colour RAM
	* Sprites
	* Background picture



* Note C5 200P capacitor, check it is a ceramic disc on the board



* Parts list, Book of Materials, stock code links to ordering websites needed

* Reorganise the memory map detection logic, remove 3M:A for ROMs, 3M:B 4M 5M 2S:B 1C:A
	Add new memory block detection for _9800CS, _9A00CS, _9C00CS, _9E00CS
	Use a memory block that is not used by the expansion RAM, perhaps the BASIC ROM area
	Check the CPU memory expansion, BUSDDR or CPUHASBUS can also be used to improve the memory block chip detection
	


* For integration with the TTL 8 bit CPU the VSYNC signal could be exposed to EXPANSIONBUS:EXTWANTIRQ
	Remove extra unused logic E7P:A E7P:B E6P:C 5P:A
	This will need a latch arrangement similar to the CPU latch, no use holding EXTWANTIRQ low for so long without being acked
	CPU->Root sheet 8->U250:A
		CIA1 read ACK U201:A



* Allow the _HSYNC and _VSYNC to be read via the external header, as memory mapped IO. Probably reuse the number of sprite register see _9A00CS
	This would need _MERD to be added to the external header. Also the BUSDDR would need to be used to enable the correct tri-state output
* Allow RH AND RV to be accessed via memory mapped IO
	
	
	



* The expansion bus and the memory write signals will need to be translated to the internal memory write signals




* VSM Pattern generator clock input bug
	When the clock input is set to external positive edge but is not on the root sheet then the signal is not used?
	The pattern generator windows still pop-up though, although they do not scroll.

	
	
* 4C/4D when run at 6MHz will generate "sub optimal write pulses" errors with default values. Running at 1MHz fixes these issues.
	* The output pixel data seems to be better when the timing is reduced.
	* Investigate the output for read/write timings of these memory ICs for 6MHz operation.

	
	
* There is also the possibility to allow the horizontal pixel clock and/or the vertical raster position to be read via a latch and suitable address chip enable logic of an 8 bit latch



* Instead of using ROMs, use RAMs and add extra logic to enable their write via the external header.



* Split this layout so that different output planes can be added or removed via internal headers, daisy-chained probably.
	The final combination logic can then take the output pixels and combine the final result via the pallet lookups
