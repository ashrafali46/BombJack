* Output video signal with resistor ladder. Exclude from simulation once analog behavior has been verified.



* Removed duplicate component references that were causing incorrect auto router errors.



* Sheet 8 - Palette read/write logic



* Need a VSM model for a display that takes digital RGB + HSYNC + VSYNC

* Interesting logic with _9A00CS 7R 6R 6S 5R 5S as it is only taking DB0-3 which implies a value 0-15 only. Hmm.
	Resulted in discovering new 0x9a00/0x9a01 functionality for sprite size select, documented in README.md

	
	
* For integration with the TTL 8 bit CPU the VSYNC signal could be exposed to EXPANSIONBUS2:EXTWANTIRQ
	This is because memory writes to 0x98xx can only be made when the video HW is not accessing the sprite regs
